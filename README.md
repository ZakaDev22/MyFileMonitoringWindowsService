- Ensure the following directories specified in `App.config` exist or are created dynamically during service start:
  - **Source Folder**
  - **Destination Folder**
  - **Log Folder**

- Handle exceptions gracefully, and review the log file for any issues during testing.

- **Testing Console Mode**:
  - Ensure the service is **stopped** to avoid conflicts when running the application in console mode.

- **Testing the Service**:
  - Ensure the console mode is not running while the service is active to prevent conflicts.

- Review the log file (`ServiceStateLog.txt`) in the log folder to verify the functionality of the service.
