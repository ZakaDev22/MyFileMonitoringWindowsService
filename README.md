# My File Monitoring Windows Service


## Overview :

### The goal of this project is to design, develop, and deploy a Windows Service that monitors a specific folder for new files, processes them by renaming with a GUID,
### moves them to a destination folder, and deletes the original file. The service should include robust logging and dynamic folder configurations using an App.config file.


## Project Objectives :

### 1 - Understand the development and lifecycle of a Windows Service.
### 2 - Learn to monitor directories and handle file operations programmatically.
### 3 - Implement logging for debugging and service monitoring.
### 4 - Use configuration files (App.config) to avoid hardcoding values.
### 5 - Integrate an Installer class to prepare the service for deployment.
### 6 - Enable debugging capabilities through console mode.
